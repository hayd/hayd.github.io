duck typing vs type typing

The more I understand types the more I think they are the correct way to generalise.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of duck typing in Python and Ruby, but you don't gain the insight about the generalisation that you gain in that generalisation than when writing a function in Haskell. Of course, you may not care about the generalisation, even if may lead to faster code.



Performance

Example of non-vectorisable code in cython and in julia, show have to repeat for different dtypes in cython but don't in julia.
